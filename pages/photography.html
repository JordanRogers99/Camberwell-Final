        <h5>Here, I am looking to show examples of my favourite photography. This is an interesting area of the 
            portfolio that I am creating because I am a photographer first and foremost. Other mediums can inspire my 
            photography just as much or even more in some ways, for instance music and film is more likely to be 
            what gets me up and wanting to make something. But, my influences in photography are the most visible when it 
            comes to the work I make myself. 
        </h5>

        <h5>I have been told my univeristy tutors and friends that my work reminds them of someboody elses on 
            a few occasions, and usually these comparisons are my direct influences. In some ways, I struggle to push 
            away from their influence, but throughout my work on Unit 10, I have used AI to bring something different 
            into the style of work that I am typically such a fan of. I hope that the influences remain 
            visible, but I also hope that I am creating work that is able to get away from the grip of the work that 
            influences me.
