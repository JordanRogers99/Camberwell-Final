            <h5>On this page of the website, my primary goal is to put forward the best inspirations I can think of within the 
                realm of sound. This is a very personal and meaningful area to most people, and it certainly is for me. 
                Music is the most universal artform ever created, many people can fall in love with a specific medium but 
                music seems to profoundly impact the human spirit. I am not limiting this to music, because the human 
                voice and storytelling is also a part of this, but we all are personally connected to songs 
                and I wanted to include some of these influences here.
            </h5>
            <h5>The audio all effects me in different ways and I will explain them all individually. However, one common 
                note to make of them all is that they have had an incredible impact on how I live my life.
            </h5>
            <h5>Some of the music has shaped me as a person since my teenage years, and I will credit another piece of 
                audio with making me believe in life all over again. I listen to audio constantly when I am doing 
                my photography, I can't imagine going shooting without it in most cases. If I am filming a short 
                creative film in my bedroom at 3am, the music will fit that mood. Furthermore, the following pieces 
                of audio have shaped my philosophies, which are unavoidably important to every artist.

            <h3>The first example of audio that has impacted my photographic practice is an audio recording of Ram Dass, 
                a spiritual teacher.
            </h3>

            <p>The audio document can be found at <span><a href="https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/lt3wg4b98oupgkqry8t

            <h5>This audio used to be on YouTube and was taken down, and I spent over a year regularly posting in 
                different websites asking for help finding a remaining trace of it. Eventually, a stranger sent me it.
            </h5>

            <h5>This audio has been my saving grace throughout my time at university. It has repeatedly 
                made me believe in life, through a series of financial struggles and personal problems. This audio 
                inspires my work for a variety of reasons.
            </h5>

            <h5>Most prominently, the words of Ram Dass in this clip in particular have made me realise that I am 
                not going anywhere, I can relax and accept where I am. I can create, because lifes struggles aren't everything.
                It is very easy for me to say 'I will make work when I sort my life out' but this clip helps me to know 
                that I have already arrived, I am allowed to do things that aren't quantifiably practical, because they 
                are essential to my happiness as a person. This philosophy has changed my life and ensured that I work 
                on my creative projects.

            <h5>This song means a lot to my practice because it has been a companion on many of my shoots since I was 
                17. At home, I would drive around in the early hours of the morning in the countryside and listen to this song, 
                stopping to take pictures in random locations.
            </h5>
            <h5>The lyrics of the song have always spoken to me but the sound of this audio is so specific, so unique to 
                this song and my personal memory of the first time hearing it, something in this song and my conncetion to it means 
                that my hair stands on end when I hear it and I am immediately feeling inspired.
            </h5>
            <h5>So much of my inspiration comes from this, it is not quantifiable, but the feeling of inspiration is 
                undeinably wtihin me nonetheless. This song, above any other, brings this out of me.
