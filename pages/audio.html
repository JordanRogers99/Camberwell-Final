        <div class="opening">
            <h5>On this page of the website, my primary goal is to put forward the best inspirations I can think of within the 
                realm of sound. This is a very personal and meaningful area to most people, and it certainly is for me. 
                Music is the most universal artform ever created, many people can fall in love with a specific medium but 
                music seems to profoundly impact the human spirit. I am not limiting this to music, because the human 
                voice and storytelling is also a part of this, but we all are personally connected to songs 
                and I wanted to include some of these influences here.
            </h5>
            <h5>The audio all effects me in different ways and I will explain them all individually. However, one common 
                note to make of them all is that they have had an incredible impact on how I live my life.
            </h5>
            <h5>Some of the music has shaped me as a person since my teenage years, and I will credit another piece of 
                audio with making me believe in life all over again. I listen to audio constantly when I am doing 
                my photography, I can't imagine going shooting without it in most cases. If I am filming a short 
                creative film in my bedroom at 3am, the music will fit that mood. Furthermore, the following pieces 
                of audio have shaped my philosophies, which are unavoidably important to every artist.

            <h3>The first example of audio that has impacted my photographic practice is an audio recording of Ram Dass, 
                a spiritual teacher.
            </h3>

            <p>The audio document can be found at <span><a href="https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/lt3wg4b98oupgkqry8t

                This link</a></span></p>

            <h5>This audio used to be on YouTube and was taken down, and I spent over a year regularly posting in 
                different websites asking for help finding a remaining trace of it. Eventually, a stranger sent me it.
            </h5>

            <h5>This audio has been my saving grace throughout my time at university. It has repeatedly 
                made me believe in life, through a series of financial struggles and personal problems. This audio 
                inspires my work for a variety of reasons.
            </h5>

            <h5>Most prominently, the words of Ram Dass in this clip in particular have made me realise that I am 
                not going anywhere, I can relax and accept where I am. I can create, because lifes struggles aren't everything.
                It is very easy for me to say 'I will make work when I sort my life out' but this clip helps me to know 
                that I have already arrived, I am allowed to do things that aren't quantifiably practical, because they 
                are essential to my happiness as a person. This philosophy has changed my life and ensured that I work 
                on my creative projects.

            <h3>'Mayonaise' - Smashing Pumpkins</h3>
            <p>A link to the audio can be found at</p>
            <h5>This song means a lot to my practice because it has been a companion on many of my shoots since I was 
                17. At home, I would drive around in the early hours of the morning in the countryside and listen to this song, 
                stopping to take pictures in random locations.
            </h5>
            <h5>The lyrics of the song have always spoken to me but the sound of this audio is so specific, so unique to 
                this song and my personal memory of the first time hearing it, something in this song and my conncetion to it means 
                that my hair stands on end when I hear it and I am immediately feeling inspired.
            </h5>
            <h5>So much of my inspiration comes from this, it is not quantifiable, but the feeling of inspiration is 
                undeinably wtihin me nonetheless. This song, above any other, brings this out of me.

            <h3>'Hunky Dory' - An album by David Bowie</h3>
            <p>A link to the audio can be found at</p>
            <h5>This audio means a lot to my practice because of it's beautiful sound, the slightly softened and unclear sound 
                that is everpresent with recordings from the early 1970s. This, alongside the fact that I have never heard an album 
                like it. It is unique, it's not his best known album and yet it has always been my favourite. Similar to my take on Mayonaise, 
                there is something about how this whole album feels that brings me to attention. I hear it and I smile, and 
                it's always had this effect since I was very young.
            </h5>
            <h5>I first found it when I first studied photography in college, and I think that it gave me a feeling that I could
                also be creative, and it could be good. It felt human and natural, it wasn't trying to be anything, it's just  
                a creative expression. If I am behing honest, I've always found that more impressive and interesting than art 
                that tries to make political points. It might not be 'correct' to feel this way, but Bowie's music often 
                felt like it gave you permission to enjoy the innocence and make art for arts sake.</h5>

            <h3>The Lex Fridman Podcast</h3>
            <p>A link to the audio can be found at</p>
            <h5>This podcast has changed my life immeasurably. At the age of 19, I was working in a hotel in my hometown 
                doing 12 hour shifts every day, and it was very hard work. I was very depressed and unsure of where I was 
                going in my life, and his podcasts were a strong motivating force to go and pursue whatever made me happy.
            </h5>
            <h5>After I first started listening, I really stepped up my photography in a way that I hadn't when I was studying in college. 
                He is the reason that I pursued the passion and believed that hard work and passion was enough 
                to get me there. I never believed in myself before this podcast, and his undying enjoyment surrounding life 
                and passion has been contageous. Now, I enjoy bringing my photography on my travels, and into the worlds of my 
                other passions in a documentary style. He made me want to document life, and the documentation gave me a reason 
                to do anything in life. This podcast is one of the primary reasons that I am a photographer, and 
                he has had a huge influence on my life philosophy which impacts every aspect of my work.
