            <p><h5>Here, I am going to show some artworks that I feel very connected to and certain about. In this 
                section, I am focusing on visual works that are not photography, such as illustrations and
                videography. 
            </h5></p>
            <p><h5>Mediums such as moving image are fascinating for me because of how they can change my thoughts 
                and emotions. I love old video and old films for instance, because it takes me completely away from 
                where I am and sets me down in a new world. For this reason, I am also a fan of surrealism. I have
                always wished that I could draw or illustrate well because of the world building possibilites. 
                In my photography, I really aim to create a feeling of a different world. I like that I can make things seem
                a little different or uncanny and place someone in a world that they haven't seen, even for a few
                moments. I love when it happens to me, I can find it difficult to look away from my favourite artists
                that represent this skill, and I always aim to do so.</h5></p>
                
                <p><h5>Illustrations are able to create from scratch, 
                and if the feeling is right with what they create, it can be incredible. I take a huge amount of inspiration
                from the following art.</h5></p>

            <h3>The first piece of work I would like to show is 'Destino'. This work was illustrated by Salvador Dali &
                Walt Disney, in collaboration together. 
            </h3>

            <h5>I like this work because of the feeling that it creates, alonside it's 'world-building' nature.
                I am in love with this work because of how far away it takes me. It is a beautiful example of a piece of 
                work that makes you feel like you have entered the artists dimension. In this case, the music 
                adds massively to the content for me.
            </h5>

            <h5>The music that goes along with film is something that I take with me on my shoots. I will put the 
                sountracks to films on my Spotify and walk around the streets taking pictures. I do this because the 
                film used the music at an opportune moment, or in this case throughout, and those scenes 
                made me feel inspired, and the feeling from the song carries over to the point of my own creation.
            </h5>

            <h5>This illustration/short film has served as a strong source of inspiration for me for years now
                and I consistently get the same intense feeling of inspiration from it. I love showing it to other 
                people for the first time, and it is one of my favourite pieces of art ever made.
