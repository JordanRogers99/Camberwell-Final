            <p><h5>Here, I am going to show some artworks that I feel very connected to and certain about. In this 
                section, I am focusing on visual works that are not photography, such as illustrations and
                videography. 
            </h5></p>
            <p><h5>Mediums such as moving image are fascinating for me because of how they can change my thoughts 
                and emotions. I love old video and old films for instance, because it takes me completely away from 
                where I am and sets me down in a new world. For this reason, I am also a fan of surrealism. I have
                always wished that I could draw or illustrate well because of the world building possibilites. 
                In my photography, I really aim to create a feeling of a different world. I like that I can make things seem
                a little different or uncanny and place someone in a world that they haven't seen, even for a few
                moments. I love when it happens to me, I can find it difficult to look away from my favourite artists
                that represent this skill, and I always aim to do so. Illustrations are able to create from scratch, 
                and if the feeling is right with what they create, it can be incredible. I take a huge amount of inspiration
                from the following art.

                Walt Disney, in collaboration together.
