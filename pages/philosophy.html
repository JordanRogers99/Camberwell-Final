    <div class="titlePhil"><h1>Philosophy</h1></div>

<div class="opening">
   <p><h5>Below, I am going to add a series of the philosophies that inspire
        my artistic practice and my worldview. These philosophies serve as more inspiration
        to me than the vast majority of artistic works that I enjoy, the reason for this 
        being that I may not write well but I do relate to written word in a very
        powerful way.
    </h5></p>
    <p><h5>I am the person that is forever looking at quotes, forever reading books
        and forever feeling that I can't express myself as I would like to with words, as 
        some others can in their special way. I don't give up on this personal pursuit
        myself, but equally I take what I can get and I use their abilities as fuel
        in my own personal artisti pursuits.
    </h5></p>
    <p><h5>My belief, overall, is that I must live my life in such a way that I feel free
        to create.

    <h3>Martha Graham</h3>
    <div class="quotes"><p>'There is a vitality, a life force, a quickening that is translated through you into action, and there is only one of you in all time, 
        this expression is unique, and if you block it, it will never exist through any other medium; and be lost. 
        The world will not have it. It is not your business to determine how good it is, nor 
        how it compares with other expression. It is your business to keep it yours clearly and directly, 
        to keep the channel open. You do not even have to believe in yourself or your work. You have to keep open and aware directly 
        to the urges that motivate you. Keep the channel open. No artist is pleased. There is no satisfaction whatever at any time. There 
        is only a queer, divine dissatisfaction, a blessed unrest that keeps us marching and makes us more alive than the others.</p></div>
        <h5>(Graham, n.d.)</h5>

        <h5>My interest in this quote comes from the fact that it brings a romantic element to making
            art, which I have always liked because it keeps you sure that you are doing something worthwhile. It puts 
            a value on the individual that creates and their uniqueness in terms of what they can bring to the table. 
        </h5>
        <h5>It can be easy for me to lose track of the value of something that I cannot quantify,
            and I am reminded that it is valuable because of how it makes me feel to create. Feeling inspired and
            feeling that I am taking on a worthwile pursuit is vital to creating work that I am proud of.

        <h3>George Orwell</h3>
        <div class="quotes">“Now I will tell you the answer to my question. It is this. The Party seeks power entirely for its 
            own sake. We are not interested in the good of others; we are interested solely in power, pure power. What pure 
            power means you will understand presently. We are different from the oligarchies of the past in that we know what 
            we are doing. All the others, even those who resembled ourselves, were cowards and hypocrites. The German Nazis 
            and the Russian Communists came very close to us in their methods, but they never had the courage to recognize their
             own motives. They pretended, perhaps they even believed, that they had seized power unwillingly and for a 
             limited time, and that just around the corner there lay a paradise where human beings would be free and equal. 
             We are not like that. We know that no one ever seizes power with the intention of relinquishing it. Power is 
             not a means; it is an end. One does not establish a dictatorship in order to safeguard a revolution; one makes 
             the revolution in order to establish the dictatorship. The object of persecution is persecution. The object of 
             torture is torture. The object of power is power. Now you begin to understand me.”</div>
        <H5>My interest in this quote comes from the fact that Orwell is so good at telling stories. In this book, 
            1984, he was able to depict not just the scene, but the feeling. He was a profound author, his stories went 
            beyond fiction and forced us to feel his words and contemplate them.
        </H5>
        <h5>(Orwell, n.d.)</h5>

        <h5>I take huge inspiration from his work for this reason. My favourite photography is capable of the same, and 
            that is what I look to do when I create imagery. I want my work to feel profound and impactful in some way, 
            although it is difficult to tell when you are and are not succeeding. 
        </h5>

        <h5>Orwell used words, his medium of choice, to portray a feeling. This is often where my ambitions start and end, 
            but he reminds me that your work can make the viewer or reader contemplate those feelings. That is when work becomes
            profound, and I can only hope to achieve what he could, on some scale, at some point in my life. This 
            constantly drives my work.

        <h3>Charles Bukowski</h3>
        <div class="quotes">“If you're going to try, go all the way. Otherwise, don't even start. This could mean losing 
            girlfriends, wives, relatives and maybe even your mind. It could mean not eating for three or four days. It could 
            mean freezing on a park bench. It could mean jail. It could mean derision. It could mean mockery--isolation. 
            Isolation is the gift. All the others are a test of your endurance, of how much you really want to do it. And, 
            you'll do it, despite rejection and the worst odds. And it will be better than anything else you can imagine. 
            If you're going to try, go all the way. There is no other feeling like that. You will be alone with the gods, 
            and the nights will flame with fire. You will ride life straight to perfect laughter. It's the only good fight 
            there is.”</div>
            <h5>(Bukowski, n.d.)</h5>
        <H5>I love Charles Bukowski because of the powerful use of his tools.</H5>
        <h5>Bukowski, to me, is the best at utilising his skills as a wordsmith. His ability to speak so poetically and yet 
            so penetratably, in a way that can be heard and understood by anybody, is incredible. It makes you want to 
            master your craft, his phrasing will get me out of bed at the drop of a hat. Usually, this is because I find it
            inspiring, but his work is not inspiring in the motivational sense.
        </h5>
        <h5>His work, on the contrary, can be very depressing and he embraced isolation and alcoholism. I do not agree 
            with those values, I don't want them in my life, and yet his phrasing is just so beautiful that I can't help 
            but love it. I constantly am aiming for my work to supercede any requirement for a captive audience, and for the 
            work to speak for itself. He is another master of his craft that serves as constant inspiration in my life and 
            my work.

        <h3>Hunter S. Thompson</h3>
        <div class="quotes">“The Edge... There is no honest way to explain it because the only people who really know where it 
            is are the ones who have gone over. The others-the living-are those who pushed their control as far as they felt 
            they could handle it, and then pulled back, or slowed down, or did whatever they had to when it came time to choose 
            between Now and Later. But the edge is still Out there.”</div>
            <h5>(Thompson, n.d.)</h5>
        <H5>Hunter S. Thompson is an incredible writer and journalist.</H5>
        <h5>I have taken a great interest in photojournalism and even gotten a job in the field, because of the 
            inspiration that this man has brought to my work. Aside from my artistic practice, I have always wanted to create 
            work that makes a difference and goes beyond the aspirational art gallery walls.

        <h5>He had a travelling cowboy image surrounding him, he lived a dangerous and risky life and his extremely 
            unique and hyper-original takes on his surroundings made him the voice of his generation. To me, he represents 
            something that I personally consider to be a true artist.
        </h5>
        <h5>I try to live with an attitude that is inspired by his, he was curious and a complete individual, he travelled 
            and found great happiness in his life and his creations. He lived creatively, and that is what I try to do too.
            Creativity can go beyond mere creation, and you can live life in a creative way that nobody did the same way.
            He has helped to keep me a creative at heart, and my working life is massively influenced by him.
