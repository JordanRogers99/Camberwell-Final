    <div class="titlePhil"><h1>Philosophy</h1></div>

<div class="opening">
   <p><h5>Below, I am going to add a series of the philosophies that inspire
        my artistic practice and my worldview. These philosophies serve as more inspiration
        to me than the vast majority of artistic works that I enjoy, the reason for this 
        being that I may not write well but I do relate to written word in a very
        powerful way.
    </h5></p>
    <p><h5>I am the person that is forever looking at quotes, forever reading books
        and forever feeling that I can't express myself as I would like to with words, as 
        some others can in their special way. I don't give up on this personal pursuit
        myself, but equally I take what I can get and I use their abilities as fuel
        in my own personal artisti pursuits.
    </h5></p>
    <p><h5>My belief, overall, is that I must live my life in such a way that I feel free
        to create.
    </h5></p>

<div class="PhilOne">
    <h3>Martha Graham</h3>
    <div class="quotes"><p>'There is a vitality, a life force, a quickening that is translated through you into action, and there is only one of you in all time, 
        this expression is unique, and if you block it, it will never exist through any other medium; and be lost. 
        The world will not have it. It is not your business to determine how good it is, nor 
        how it compares with other expression. It is your business to keep it yours clearly and directly, 
        to keep the channel open. You do not even have to believe in yourself or your work. You have to keep open and aware directly 
        to the urges that motivate you. Keep the channel open. No artist is pleased. There is no satisfaction whatever at any time. There 
        is only a queer, divine dissatisfaction, a blessed unrest that keeps us marching and makes us more alive than the others.</p></div>

        <h5>My interest in this quote comes from the fact that it brings a romantic element to making
            art, which I have always liked because it keeps you sure that you are doing something worthwhile. It puts 
            a value on the individual that creates and their uniqueness in terms of what they can bring to the table. 
        </h5>
        <h5>It can be easy for me to lose track of the value of something that I cannot quantify,
            and I am reminded that it is valuable because of how it makes me feel to create. Feeling inspired and
            feeling that I am taking on a worthwile pursuit is vital to creating work that I am proud of.
