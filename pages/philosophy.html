    <h1>Philosophy</h1>

<div class="opening">
   <p><h5>Below, I am going to add a series of the philosophies that inspire
        my artistic practice and my worldview. These philosophies serve as more inspiration
        to me than the vast majority of artistic works that I enjoy, the reason for this 
        being that I may not write well but I do relate to written word in a very
        powerful way.

        in my own personal artisti pursuits.
    </h5></p>
    <p><h5>My belief, overall, is that I must live my life in such a way that I feel free
        to create.

        The world will not have it. It is not your business to determine how good it is, nor 
        how it compares with other expression. It is your business to keep it yours clearly and directly, 
        to keep the channel open. You do not even have to believe in yourself or your work. You have to keep open and aware directly 
        to the urges that motivate you. Keep the channel open. No artist is pleased. There is no satisfaction whatever at any time. There 
        is only a queer, divine dissatisfaction, a blessed unrest that keeps us marching and makes us more alive than the others.</p>
