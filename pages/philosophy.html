    <h1>Philosophy</h1>

    <div class="opening">
   <p><h5>Below, I am going to add a series of the philosophies that inspire
        my artistic practice and my worldview. These philosophies serve as more inspiration
        to me than the vast majority of artistic works that I enjoy, the reason for this 
        being that I may not write well but I do relate to written word in a very
        powerful way.
    </h5></p>
    <p><h5>I am the person that is forever looking at quotes, forever reading books
        and forever feeling that I can't express myself as I would like to with words, as 
        some others can in their special way. I don't give up on this personal pursuit
        myself, but equally I take what I can get and I use their abilities as fuel
        in my own personal artisti pursuits.
    </h5></p>
    <p><h5>My belief, overall, is that I must live my life in such a way that I feel free
        to create.
    </h5></p>
