    <p>This is my portfolio, including a variety of my own work, and my primary influences and inspirations.
        I truly love creation, and I find myself very much in love with the forces that inspire me, whether that it music, people,
        topics or other artforms.
    </p>

    <p>I aim to represent these inspirations through the content of this portfolio, but also through coding the entire 
        website myself and trying to make it something that exemplifies what I find to be interesting. By having a sense of creative
        control over the portfolio itself, I think I can offer the best version of where I am at. One day,
        I can look back at the website and it will be a small and blurry mirror, giving insight into who I was 
        and how I wanted to represent my work in 2024.
