        <h1>Jordan Rogers - Fine Art Photography</h1>
        <h2>Unit 10</h2>
        <h3>Element 2</h3>
    </div>

    <p>This is a portfolio including my primary influences and inspirations.
        I truly love creation, and I find myself very much in love with the forces that inspire me, whether that it music, people,
        topics or other artforms.
    </p>

    <p>I aim to represent these inspirations through the content of this portfolio, but also through coding the entire 
        website myself and trying to make it something that exemplifies what I find to be interesting. By having a sense of creative
        control over the portfolio itself, I think I can offer the best version of where I am at. One day,
        I can look back at the website and it will be a small and blurry mirror, giving insight into who I was 
        and how I wanted to represent my work in 2024.
    </p>

    <P>I have chosen to prominently use quotes across the entire website. This is because I love literature, reading and 
        I am always saving quotes to my phone. I have always found words to be very powerful and inspiring to my practice, and 
        to my life. The quotes are used throughout every section, which are to be differentiated by the mediums that each 
        inspiration is within, and there is also a separate section on the philosophy and authors who inspire me.
    </P>
    <p>There are 4 pages aside from this page which can be found at the top of the page by clicking on each one. Each section 
        aims to give a brief description of the reason I am inspired by the source that I am using.
    </p>
    <p>I have coded this website from scratch entirely by myself. I felt that this was the best way to represent which work 
        means a lot to me and why, with complete creative freedom within the realm of my coding capabilities that I have learned 
        whilst studying this degree, primarily for my previous unit and since then.
    </p>
    <p>I tend to think that my work is inspired by a variety of key elements that are known to me, and then some 
        less quantifiable elements based on how the work makes me feel. I will attempt to list these qualities that I find 
        inspiring, that should be reflected in the work throughout this site.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Colour tones.</li>
        <li>Composition.</li>
        <li>A feeling of mystery and an uncertain nature to the images.</li>
        <li>An uncanny feeling to an image.</li>
        <li>Surrealism.</li>
        <li>World building.</li>
        <li>Soft finishes to edits.</li>
        <li>A feeling of rebellion and freedom.</li>
        <li>Instant emotional impact upon first viewing the photo.</li>
        <li>A strong sense of meaning, whether it is beauty or philosophical, I like it to be clear.</li>
        <li>A feeling of peace and tranquility amongst darkness and mystery.</li>
        <li>Nostalgia.</li>
    </ul>
